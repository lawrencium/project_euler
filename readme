I like to do Project Euler problems during my spare time. Here are my solutions to some of the problems
(found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives). This repo contains an old_solutions directory which contains the very
first problems that I worked on, which I think is fun to revisit every once in a while to see how my coding style has
changed over time.
