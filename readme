I like to do Project Euler problems during my spare time. Here are my solutions to some of the problems (found here: https://projecteuler.net/archives). This repo contains an old_solutions directory which contains the very first problems that I worked on.

old_solutions contains implementations for the following problems:
# 1~50
# 52~59
# 63
# 67
# 76~77
# 79
# 81~84
# 92
# 96~97
# 99
# 107

All other problems I've solved can be found in the directory p<problem-number>.
